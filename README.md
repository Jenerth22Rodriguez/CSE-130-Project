# CSE-130-Project
## This is my final project for my C/C++ class.
### The project entails the development of a comprehensive rental car system program. Users have the capability to navigate through our database seamlessly, allowing them to explore and check the availability of various cars. The system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface in the terminal, making it easy for customers to access relevant information such as car details, rental rates, and current availability.
